# Socket-programming-for-computer-control-using-Hand-Gestures
This project is an Implementation of socket programming to transmit hand gesture data between two different clients.
We have used raspberry pi to implement this project. A camera is attached to the raspberry-pi module which tracks the moment of the hand.
This data is transmitted to another client through socketswhere gesture control is performed.
